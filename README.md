# crypto-app
 Built this Crypto Application with React JS (styled with Tailwind CSS) for the front-end and a Firebase back-end.
 
 1.   I use the Coin Gecko API for all of the realtime data display on the app.
 2.   API calls are made using Axios. You can seach through the returned cryptos using the ".filter()" in javascript.
 3.   Added functionality in this project includes user authentication and firestore, a cloud-storage database.
 4.   Whenever a new user signs up their email is stored in the firestore database and the user is able to store user specific data into the database. 
 5.   This app is hosted on Firebase.
